# x86-Assembly examples

Random bits of code and notes to generate images and boot some assembly code for
hardware setup. This is a messy collection of old code I have lying around
that I didn't touch for a few years. They are left here in case someone finds
use for them, but are mostly **UNTESTED** and possibly broken. Some are stubs I
started and never finished. Use at your own risk.

These low-level routines for hardware setup and access were written mainly as a
hobby to learn more about hardware setup on a desktop. Most of the resources
were obtained from http://wiki.osdev.org. Also, you're probably better off
learning from that page or reading somebody else's code. Code comments are in
English and Brazilian Portuguese.
